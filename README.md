# README Generatior

## Description:

This is a Node.JS application that generates a README.md page based on user input. I made this application to quickly and easily create a professional looking README file that needs little to no extra editing. It takes advantage of Node's built in FileSystem methods, and a third party NPM package called Inquirer.
